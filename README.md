### Introduction
_Twitchy Desktop Lite_ is a Lightweight Desktop App for Twitch. Twitchy is powered by Electron, a custom browser with less overhead than an actual browser. Twitchy itself comes with 3 optional extensions: [uBlock Origin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en), [BetterTTV](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/betterttv/ajopnjidmegmdimjlfnijceegpefgped?hl=en) and [FrankerfaceZ](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/frankerfacez/fadndhdgpmmaapbmfcknlfgcflmmmieb?hl=en) and many more settings based on what you prefer to use.

### The Idea
At first Twitchy was meant to be a private solution in order to reduce the overhead of bloated browsers. While the [Official Twitch Desktop Application](https://app.twitch.tv/) exists and greatly solves those above mentioned issues, it's still fairly experimental and comes with a lot of unnecessary features in our opinion. Additionally as some user might already know, it's currently not supporting some must-have extensions like _BetterTTV_ (Chat Enhancements), _uBlock Origin_ (AD Blocker) and _FrankerfaceZ_ (Chat Enhancements) so we wanted to change that.

### Core Features
- Simple & Easy to use Twitch.tv Desktop App
- Supports: uBlock Origin, BetterTTV and FrankerfaceZ
- Reduced overhead & behind-the-scenes optimizations
- Preferences to improve your general experience

### Roadmap & Future Goals
We're currently fully focusing on adding the core features. Feature requests are welcome but will most likely not be worked on before we're done with the core features. ([Visual Roadmap](https://github.com/Armaldio/twitchy-desktop-lite/projects/2))
